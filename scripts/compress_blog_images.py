# FILE: scripts/compress_blog_images.py
"""
A utility script to find and compress images for the ARLA blog.

This script scans the `docs/blog/assets` directory for common image formats
(JPEG, PNG) and creates web-optimized versions. It resizes images to a
maximum width while maintaining aspect ratio and saves them with a lower
quality setting to reduce file size.

This helps improve the blog's page load speed without significantly
impacting visual quality.
