# ARLA: The Agent Simulation Framework

## Core Features

### High-Performance Core
Built on an asynchronous, concurrent foundation, ARLA is designed for speed and efficiency, enabling complex simulations with thousands of agents.

### Cognitively-Rich Agents
Move beyond simple rules. ARLA's architecture is built to support sophisticated cognitive models, including memory, reflection, and goal-setting powered by LLMs.

### Modular & Extensible
With a clean separation of data and logic (ECS), ARLA is designed for research. Easily add new actions, systems, and components without touching the core engine.

## Get Started in Minutes
